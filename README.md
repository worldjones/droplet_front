# DAT3 web startcode `v2`

This project can be used for further assignments @ Copenhagen Business Academy, Computer Science, Semester 3 for the group NextLevel.

This project takes the principles from [startcode](https://github.com/muniaxe/ca3-front-end) project made for course assigment 3 while implementing additional features and with a different design pattern in mind for routing.  
This project is an alternative to the original startcode.

Additionally this project was developed using [startcode `v2` backend server](https://github.com/Dyrhoi/dat3-startcode-v2-server)

## Get started

I recommend using yarn as this project was made with yarn as the package manager.  
`npm install --global yarn`

## Available commands

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
